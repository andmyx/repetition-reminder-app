# repetition-reminder-app

## What?
repetition-reminder-app is a simple app that will help you to study more efficiently and to remember more of what you have learned. The app tries to combat the [forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve) utilizing [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).

## How?
When you learn something new, after a lecture for example, you create a reminder in the app. Later, the app will send you a push notification on specific times to remind you to repeat what you have learned. The interval between the notifications are chosen to help combat the forgetting curve, and thereby help you remember what you have learned for longer.

## Why?
The idea repetition-reminder-app was born after a lecture on spaced repetition and the forgetting curve. We wanted to utilize the new techniques we learnt but there was no simple way to keep track of what should be repeated on every given day without involving a lot of manual labour. repition-reminder-app aims to automate this tedious process so that you can focus on retaining the knowledge you have gained.
