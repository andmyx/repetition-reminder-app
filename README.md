# repetition-reminder-app

## What?
repetition-reminder-app is a simple app that help you study more efficiently and to remember more of what you have learned. The app tries to combat the [forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve) utilizing [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).

## How?
When you have learned something new, after lecture for example, you create a reminder in the app. Later, the app will send you a push notification on specific times to remind you to repeat what you have learned. The interval between the notifications is chosen to help combat the forgetting curve, and thereby help you remember what you have learned for longer.

## Why?
The idea repetition-reminder-app was born after a lecture on spaced repetition and the forgetting curve. We wanted to utilize the new techniques we learnt but there was no simple way to keep track of what should be repeated on every given day. It is not feasible to create calendar events, believe us, we have tried.
